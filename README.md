# facebook-scraper
Data scrapers for Facebook Pages and Groups using the Facebook Graph API.

The actual data scrapers are implemented in `get_fb_posts_fb_pages.py` and `get_fb_group_to_db.py`; fill in the App ID and App Secret of a new empty Facebook app that you created and the Page ID of the Facebook Page/Group that you want to scrape at the beginning of the file.
