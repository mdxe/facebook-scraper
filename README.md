# facebook--scraper
Data scraper for Facebook Pages and Groups, and also code accompanying the blog post [How to Scrape Data From Facebook Page Posts for Statistical Analysis](http://minimaxir.com/2015/07/facebook-scraper/).

The actual data scraper is implemented in `get_fb_posts_fb_pages.py` and `get_fb_group_to_db.py`; fill in the App ID and App Secret of a Facebook app you control (I strongly recommend creating an app just for this purpose) and the Page ID of the Facebook Page you want to scrape at the beginning of the file.
